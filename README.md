# FedCardioTwin

**Continually Updated, Uncertainty-Aware Federated Digital Twins for
Patient-Specific Cardiac Monitoring Across Heterogeneous Hospitals.**

Target venue: IEEE J-BHI special issue *"Federated Learning and Digital
Twins for Smart Healthcare"* (submission 30 June 2026).

## What this is

- **Track A (federated):** 6 real institutions from the PhysioNet/CinC 2021
  corpus (CPSC, CPSC-Extra, Georgia, Chapman, Ningbo, PTB-XL) as FL clients —
  real inter-hospital non-IID, 26 official scored classes, multilabel.
- **Track B (twin):** original PTB-XL multi-record patients replayed
  chronologically; per-patient adapter twins run predict → compare → alert →
  update, with replay-based forgetting prevention.
- **Conformal layer:** federated conformal risk control gives per-hospital
  prediction sets with FNR ≤ α guarantees.

All data is public; no hardware; everything runs on a single T4.

## Experiment matrix (the paper's tables)

| Table | Command | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| Main comparison | `--stage federated` (local/fedavg/fedprox/fedbn/fedavgm/ditto/fedper × 3 seeds) | per-client + worst-client AUROC/F1 under real non-IID |
| Upper bound | `--stage centralized` | pooled-data ceiling |
| Headline | `scripts/ensemble_eval.py` | 3-seed ensemble |
| Generalization | `--stage loho` | leave-one-hospital-out: deploy on an unseen institution |
| Twin gain | `--stage twin` | cold vs warm AUROC, per-step gain curve, alert-detection AUROC, forgetting (+ raw `.npz` arrays) |
| Uncertainty | `--stage conformal` | FNR coverage + set size per hospital, on deployed per-client models |
| Communication | `history` field in federated results | AUROC vs rounds / vs cumulative upload MB |
| Significance | `scripts/make_tables.py` | mean ± std + Wilcoxon signed-rank vs FedAvg |

## Model recipe (best-results configuration)

Primary model: **SE-InceptionTime-1d** — InceptionTime (bottleneck 32,
kernels 39/19/9, depth 6, residual every 3) with squeeze-and-excitation
channel attention per block. Training: AdamW + OneCycle, AMP, random 2.5 s
crops, **ECG augmentation** (noise, amplitude scale, time mask, baseline
wander, lead dropout), **mixup** (alpha=0.2), **EMA weights** (0.999).
Evaluation: sliding-window probability averaging (stride 125) +
per-class thresholds tuned on validation. Final headline number:
**seed ensemble** via `scripts/ensemble_eval.py` (average sigmoid probs of
the 3 seed checkpoints; add resnet1d checkpoints for an architecture
ensemble). Each component is independently ablatable (`se=False`,
`augment=False`, `mixup_alpha=0`, `ema_decay=0`) for the ablation table.

## Notes

- Label space is parsed at runtime from the official challenge
  `weights.csv` / `dx_mapping_scored.csv` (cloned in `external/`) — no
  hardcoded medical codes anywhere.
- The FL engine is deliberately serial (one GPU, exact reproducibility);
  this matches standard cross-silo FL simulation practice.
